*   What is SerialVersionUID ?

>>  At the time of serialization, sender side JVM will save a unique identifier
    with every object that is to be serialized. JVM will generate this unique 
    identifier based on '.class' file of that object. This unique identifier
    is SerialVersionUID

*   What is the purpose of SerialVersionUID ?

>>  At the time of de-serialization, receiver side JVM compares unique identifier
    (SerialVersionUID) associated with the serialized object with the local class
    SerialVersionUID. 

    If both SerialVersionUID matches, then the serialized object will be 
    de-serialized by the receiver side JVm else we will get InvalidClassException.

*   What are the problems associated with default SerialVersionUID generated by JVM ?

>>  Following are problems that will arise due to default SerialVersionUID :

    (1) If sender and receiver platform or JVM version is different then 
        SerialVersionUID generated by both JVM will be different due to which 
        at the time of de-seriaization, locally generated SerialVersionUID and 
        SerialVersionUID associated with serialized object will not match and 
        we will get InvalidClassException even if both sender and receiver has 
        same '.class' file.

    (2) If sender and receiver have same '.class' file but any one of them some 
        extra fields (variables) or methods then also their JVM generated 
        SerialVersionUID will be different and won't match.

    (3) JVM uses complex alogorith to generate SerialVersionUID due to which 
        performance will reduce as JVM have extra burden of generating 
        SerialVersionUID

    Note :  To solve above problems, we define our own SerialVersionUID for the 
            class due to which even if sender and receiver has different platform 
            or there is some changes in their '.class' file their SerialVersionUID 
            will be same.

*   How to define our own SerialVersionUID ?

>>  To define our own SerialVersionUID, we can define it in the class in 
    following way :

    ```
    class Demo {

        // Demo class SerialVersionUID
        public static final long SerialVersionUID = 10;
    }
    ```

    Here, variable 'SerialVersionUID' must be public, static and final else JVM will
    generate default SerialVersionUID
