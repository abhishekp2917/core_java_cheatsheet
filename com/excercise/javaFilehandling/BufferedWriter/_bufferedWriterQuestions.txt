*   What is BufferedWriter ?

>>  BufferedWriter is use to write character data to the file similar to FileWriter,
    but main advantage of BufferedWriter over FileWriter is that we don't have to
    add line separator manually, instead there is a method to so.

    BufferedWriter doesn't write directly to the file, instead it uses another
    Writer object (FileWriter) to write into a file.

*   What are various BufferedWriter class constructors ?

>>  Following are the BufferedWriter class constructors :

    (1) This constructor is used create BufferedWriter object that uses Writer object
        to write into file

        ```
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(Writer w);
        ```

    (2) This constructor is used create BufferedWriter object that uses Writer object
        with specified bufferedSize to write into file
 
        ```
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(Writer w, int bufferedSize);
        ```

*   Which are valid and invalid BufferedWriter object creation ?

>>  Below are valid BufferedWriter object creation :

    (1) BufferedWriter object using FileWriter object to write into file named 
        "abc.txt" 

        ```
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("abc.txt"));
        ```
    
    (2) BufferedWriter object using another BufferedWriter object which uses 
        FileWriter object to write into file named "abc.txt" 

        ```
        BufferedWriter bw1 = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("abc.txt"));

        BufferedWriter bw2 = new BufferedWriter(bw1);
        ```

    Below are invalid BufferedWriter object creation :

    (1) BufferedWriter object using file named "abc.txt" to write into it directly

        ```
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter("abc.txt");
        ```
    
    (2) BufferedWriter object using File object refering to file named "abc.txt" 
        to write into it directly

        ```
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new File("abc.txt"));
        ```

    (3) BufferedWriter object using File object refering to directory named "abc" 
        to write into it directly

        ```
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new File("abc"));
        ```

    (4) BufferedWriter object using FileWriter object refering to write into 
        directory named "abc"

        ```
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("abc"));
        ```

*   What are the various important methods of BufferedWriter class ?

>>  ```
    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(Writer w);
    ```

    (1) This method is use to write single character to the file via Writer object

        ```
        void bw.write(int ch);
        ```

    (2) This method is use to write array of characters to the file via Writer object

        ```
        void bw.write(char[] ch);
        ```

    (3) This method is use to write string to the file via Writer object

        ```
        void bw.write(String s);
        ```

    (4) This method gaurantees that all the characters have been written to the file
        via Writer object

        ```
        void bw.flush();
        ```

    (5) This method is use to close the BufferedWriter and FileWriter

        ```
        void bw.close();
        ```

    (6) This method is use to insert a line separator into the file

        ```
        void bw.newLine();
        ```

            // overriding a character array to the file named "abc.txt"
            bw.write(new char[]{'2', '3', '4', '2'});

            // adding new line into the file
            bw.newLine();

            // flushing all the character if some character got stuck while writing
            bw.flush();
