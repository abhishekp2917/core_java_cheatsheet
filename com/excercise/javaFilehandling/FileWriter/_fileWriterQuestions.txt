*   What is the use of FileWriter ?

>>  We can use FileWriter to write character data to the file.

*   What are various FileWriter class constructors ?

>>  Following are the FileWriter class constructors :

    (1) This constructor is use to override the content of file named 'fileName' If
        it exist. If specified file doesn't exist then it will create a new file to 
        write characters in it.

        ```
        FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fileName);
        ```

    (2) This constructor is use to override the content of file referenced by 'file'
        if it exist. If specified file doesn't exist then it will create a new file 
        to write characters in it.

        ```
        FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File file);
        ```

    (3) This constructor is use to override as well as append the content to file 
        named 'fileName' if it exist. If specified file doesn't exist then it will 
        create a new file to write characters in it.

        ```
        FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fileName, Boolean append);
        ```

    (4) This constructor is use to override as well as append the content to file 
        referenced by 'file' if it exist. If specified file doesn't exist then it
        will create a new file to write characters in it.

        ```
        FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File file, Boolean append);
        ```

*   What are the various important methods of FileWriter class ?

>>  ```
    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fileName);
    ```

    (1) This method is use to write single character to the file

        ```
        void fw.write(int ch);
        ```

    (2) This method is use to write array of characters to the file

        ```
        void fw.write(char[] ch);
        ```

    (3) This method is use to write string to the file

        ```
        void fw.write(String s);
        ```

    (4) This method gaurantees that all the characters have been written to the file

        ```
        void fw.flush();
        ```

    (5) This method is use to close the FileWriter

        ```
        void fw.close();
        ```

            // flushing all the character if some character got stuck while writing
            fw.flush();

            // closing the FileWriter
            fw.close();

*   What is the disadvantage of using FileWriter ?

>>  In FileWriter we have to insert line separater '\n' manually which is varied 
    from system to system due to which based on system, we may get different output
    while writing in a file. To solve this problem, BufferedWriter and PrintWriter 
    are used.
