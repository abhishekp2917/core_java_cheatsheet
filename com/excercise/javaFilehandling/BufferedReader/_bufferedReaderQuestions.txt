*   What is BufferedReader ?

>>  To read character from a file, BufferedReader is used. Unlike FileReader, 
    BufferedReader can be used to read the file line by line as well. 

    BufferedReader doesn't read directly from the file, instead it uses another
    Reader object (FileReader) to read from the file.
    
    BufferedReader is most enhanced character data reader till date.

*   What are various BufferedReader class constructors ?

>>  Following are the BufferedReader class constructors :

    (1) This constructor is used to read character from the specified file using
        Reader object

        ```
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Reader r);
        ```

    (2) This constructor is used to read character from the specified file using 
        Reader object with specified bufferedSize
 
        ```
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Reader r, int bufferedSize);
        ```

*   What are the various important methods of BufferedReader class ?

>>  ```
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Writer w);
    ```

    (1) This method attempts to read next character from the file and returns its 
        unicode value (int value). If next character is not available, then this 
        method will return -1. 

        As this method return unicode value (int value), it is mandatory to type 
        cast that unicode value to char value  

        ```
        int br.read();
        ```
    
    (2) This method reads enough characters from the file into character array and 
        returns number of characters copied from the file   

        ```
        int br.read(char[] ch);
        ```

    (3) This method is used to close BufferedReader

        ```
        void br.close();
        ```

    (4) This methods to read next line from the file and return it in String form.
        If next line not available, then this method returns 'null'.

        ```
        String br.readLine();
        ```
