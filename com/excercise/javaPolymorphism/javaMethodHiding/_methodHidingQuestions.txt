*   What is method hiding ?

>>  If both parent and child having same method signature are static, then we won't 
    get any compile time error. It seems overriding concept applicable for static 
    methods but it is not overriding and it is method hiding.

*   In method hiding, on what basis method is resolved ?

>>  In method hiding method resolution is done by compiler based on reference type 
    and not based on runtime object.

    This is called method hiding and not overriding because if we call static method 
    from child object with parent reference type, then overriden method will get 
    executed and if we call static method from child object with child reference 
    type then overriding method will get executed. This shows that static method
    is only hidden and not overriden.

    But in case of overriding, if we call method from child object with any reference 
    type either of parent type or child type, always overriding method will be called
    as overriden method has been overriden by overriding method.
